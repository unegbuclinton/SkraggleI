And yet, according to another study&amp;mdash;57% of candidates don&amp;rsquo;t send them.\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\nEasy math, isn&amp;rsquo;t it? Following up on your interview with a thank you email gets you ahead of more than half of the competition.\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\nWhen to follow up after an interview?\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\nThe sooner the better&amp;mdash;the same day as the interview or the next, but definitely no later than 24 hours after the interview.\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\nWhat&amp;rsquo;s the best interview follow-up email subject line?\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\nOne that&amp;rsquo;s short and makes it clear what the message is about.

It was a pleasure to learn more about your&amp;nbsp;[innovative strategy / upcoming challenges / core values / industry insights].\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\nThe details you provided me with about the position convinced me that this is a job I would enjoy and one where I could make a valuable contribution with my skills and experience&amp;nbsp;[refer to your specific area of expertise and how it can benefit your employer].\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\nI was also thinking about what you said regarding&amp;nbsp;[specific issue discussed during the interview]. In my last role as&amp;nbsp;[your current or most recent position]&amp;nbsp;I found that&amp;nbsp;[data-backed explanation of how you would tackle the issue in question].\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\nFinally, attached you will find the details of some of my projects we talked about. Please feel free to contact me if you find you need any more information. I look forward to our call next week as discussed.\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\nThank you once again,&amp;nbsp;[Hiring Manager&amp;rsquo;s Name].\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\nBest regards,\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\n[Your sign-off]\r\n\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\n\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\nOut of all the stages of following up after an interview, this one&amp;rsquo;s the most crucial. That&amp;rsquo;s why we&amp;rsquo;ve put together a handy guide that explains how to make the most of it in full detail: Thank You Email After an Interview: How to Write One That Gets You the Job\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\n\r\n2\r\nPhone Interview Follow-Up Email: Is It Any Different?\r\n\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\nThat depends on what sort of a phone interview you had.A regular phone interview after submitting an application? The rules for a standard interview follow-up email apply.\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\nBut&amp;mdash;\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\nWhat if you&amp;rsquo;ve been screened during a sourcing process? That is&amp;mdash;what if it&amp;rsquo;s the employer that found you, and not the other way around?\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\nIf you&amp;rsquo;re interested&amp;mdash;clearly reiterate that. Sourcers often interview multiple people on the same day. Their job is to engage candidates and weed out those that aren&amp;rsquo;t genuinely keen on the offer. Show them your engagement.\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\nHow to write a follow up email after phone interview?\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\n\r\nThank them for their time and interest.\r\nEmphasize your interest. Be as specific as possible: say what parts of the job excite you and why.\r\nEnclose your resume and a cover letter to explain your motivation and outline your key selling points.\r\nKeep it short.\r\n\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\nLet&amp;rsquo;s take a look at this sample.\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\nSample Follow-Up Email After Phone Interview\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\n\r\nSubject line: Thank you for the opportunity, [Hiring Manager&amp;rsquo;s Name]!\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\nDear [Hiring Manager&amp;rsquo;s Name],\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\nThank you for talking with me today. I really appreciated learning more about [Company Name]. It was great to learn that you share my approach to [industry / business]. I particularly liked the way you [specific detail about the company you learned during the interview].\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\nI&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to meeting with you in person and discussing our cooperation further. Please find attached my resume and cover letter with detailed work experience.\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\nBest,\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\n[Your sign-off]\r\n\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\nPro Tip: Not interested in the job after the interview? Send a thank you follow-up email anyways. Thank them for their time and consideration, explain why the position isn&amp;rsquo;t a good match for your skills and experience and let them know you&amp;rsquo;d like to stay in touch if they have suitable openings. Never burn bridges on the job market.\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\nSome time after your initial interview, your phone rings again.\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\n&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re happy to inform you that you&amp;rsquo;ve been selected for a second interview&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\nCongratulations. But guess what? After the second interview, you need to send a second follow-up email.\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\n\r\n3\r\nHow to Follow Up after a Second Interview?\r\n\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\nThe biggest difference between the first and second interview follow-up emails is: the deeper your run in the recruitment process, the more detailed you should be in your messages.\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\nYou&amp;rsquo;ve probably discussed particular plans and challenges or the details of the position. After a second interview, in your follow-up letter, provide information on how you would tackle them.\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\nPro Tip: Just like with the follow-up email after the first interview: if you interviewed with several people, send separate, personalized notes to each of them.\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\nHere&amp;rsquo;s another sample.\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\nFollow-Up Email after a Second Interview Example\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\n\r\nSubject line: It was a pleasure to talk about [the name of the position] with [Company Name]\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\nDear [Interviewer&amp;rsquo;s Name],\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\nThank you for the opportunity to come and chat for the second time. Now I am even more certain that working with [the team name] would be a dream come true for me.\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\nI started to think about the [project] that we discussed&amp;mdash;I have some ideas on how we could make it successful. I describe them briefly in the attached presentation. Please, let me know what you think. I&amp;rsquo;d be happy to explain the details and hope to get the chance to discuss them with you later.\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\nThank you again for your time and advice. Looking forward to hearing from you.\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\nBest,\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\n[Your sign-off]\r\n\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\nRight.\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\nSo you&amp;rsquo;ve learned how to write a follow-up email after an interview. You crafted your perfect follow-up letter and sent it right after the talk. And then&amp;mdash;\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\nWeeks go by. And there&amp;rsquo;s no call-back.\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\nDon&amp;rsquo;t lose hope. You might still be very much in the running. And, with another follow-up email, you might become the top seed.\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\nWhen making a resume in our builder, drag &amp;amp; drop bullet points, skills, and auto-fill the boring stuff.

But only when done right.\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\nWhen to send a job interview follow-up email after no response?\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\nOnly after the established deadline has passed. Unless&amp;mdash;\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\nYou got another offer.\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\nIn such case, if you&amp;rsquo;re planning to accept it, let all other companies know.\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\nIf, on the other hand, you would rather work with this, not that company, tell them about the competitive offer&amp;mdash;if they&amp;rsquo;re interested in you, it&amp;rsquo;s very likely they&amp;rsquo;ll be eager to speed up the decision-making process.\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\nAnd what to write in your second follow-up email? \r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\nMost importantly: not much.\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\n\r\nRemind them of the passed deadline.\r\nState that you&amp;rsquo;re still interested.\r\nAsk if they&amp;rsquo;d like you to provide any additional information.\r\n\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\nHave a look at this sample.\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\nSample Second Follow-Up Email after Interview\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\n\r\nSubject line: Following up on an interview for [the name of the position]\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\nDear&amp;nbsp;[Hiring Manager&amp;rsquo;s Name],\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\nI thought I&amp;rsquo;d check in as, during our last interview, you mentioned that you&amp;rsquo;d be making the final recruitment decision for the [the name of your position]&amp;nbsp;by&amp;nbsp;[the established deadline].\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\nPlease, let me know if you have an update and if there are any additional details I could provide you with to facilitate the hiring process.Best,\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\n[Your sign-off]\r\n\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\nAnd here&amp;rsquo;s another example of a follow-up email after a job interview in case you were offered another position.\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\nSample Second Follow-Up Email&amp;mdash;Competitive Job Offer\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\n\r\nSubject line: Following up on an interview for [the name of the position]Dear&amp;nbsp;[Hiring Manager&amp;rsquo;s Name],\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\nI would like to let you know that I have been offered a position with&amp;nbsp;[Company Name]. My deadline for accepting or rejecting it passes on&amp;nbsp;[the established deadline].\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\nHowever, I&amp;rsquo;d be happy to turn down that offer if you decided to choose me as your new [the name of the position]. Please, let me know if you&amp;rsquo;re likely to reach a hiring decision before the deadline I established with&amp;nbsp;[Company Name].\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\nIf you need any additional information from me, please let me know.\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\nBest,\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\n[Your sign-off]\r\n\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\nSimple as that.\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\nNow, for the final dilemma you might be facing at this point:\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\nFollowing up on a job interview&amp;mdash;email or phone call?\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\nLet&amp;rsquo;s look at some data.\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\nThis study has shown that 46% of recruiters and hiring managers prefer to be contacted by email. Only two out of five were open to phone calls. If you&amp;rsquo;re not positive that your hiring manager would be okay with your calling them&amp;mdash;stick to the battle-tested follow-up email.\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\nPro Tip: And what if you don&amp;rsquo;t get that job? Just get over it, accept your lost opportunity, and move on, right? Wrong. Even if things didn&amp;rsquo;t work out, use this as a networking opportunity. Connect with the hiring manager on LinkedIn and keep the conversation going: maybe send some articles that might be relevant to them, congratulate on their accomplishments. You never know what connections might prove useful in the future.\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\nSpeaking of networking&amp;mdash;you might be wondering &amp;ldquo;what&amp;rsquo;s in it for me anyways?&amp;rdquo; Get inspired and learn how to network from Elle Torres: a girl who networked her way into a 6-figure job in her 20s, before finishing her degree, without any prior connections: How to Network Your Way Intro a $100,000 Job: Real-Life Story\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\nAnd, whatever stage of your job search you&amp;rsquo;re on right now, make sure you know how to use one of the most powerful tools you&amp;rsquo;ve got at hand: LinkedIn.

Suggest how you can help the company with their challenges.\r\nWrite a second follow-up email to ask for an update If you get no response after the established deadline.\r\nFollow-up even sooner if you&amp;rsquo;ve received another offer, whether or not you&amp;rsquo;re planning to accept it.\r\nStay in touch with the company&amp;mdash;even if you don&amp;rsquo;t get the job.

Just get over it, accept your lost opportunity, and move on, right? Wrong. Even if things didn&rsquo;t work out, use this as a networking opportunity.
